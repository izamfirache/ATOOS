# ATOOS
Automated Testing for Object Oriented Software.

The main purpose of this project is to automate the unit test generation process as much as possible.

Tasks performed automatically: unit test boilerplate code, mocking external dependencies, creating unit test project/classes, 
add basic unit tests which assert if no exception was thrown on a specific call.
